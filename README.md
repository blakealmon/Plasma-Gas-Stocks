# Plasma-Gas-Stocks
Celebr8 Project for School

This Project was made for a end of the year project for my 8th grade year before highschool.


The code that I have created takes an image through the webcam, then it splits the image in half, then goes through every pixel of the image getting the color code, from there
it adds all the color codes together to get a value of each side. 

Then my program compares both integers produced from the color codes and decides which one is bigger.

With that information it trades a stock based on which side of the image is bigger.

The API that I use to trade a stock in real time is call Alpaca API.

The final touch was to print out the stock that was traded and both color codes of each side of the image.
